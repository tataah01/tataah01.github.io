# About
<p>
Hi, I'm a full time project manager at a software company. I'm also a Computer Science master's student at Georgia Tech with a 
specialization in Computing Systems in the OMSCS program.

I'm participating in bioinfomatic research in McGrath Lab where we are studying the behavior of cichlid bowers through machine 
learning and computer vision. I work with improving the automated pipeline project.
