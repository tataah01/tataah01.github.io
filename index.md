# About
<p>
Hi, I'm a full time project manager in the software industry. Formerly, I worked in 
software QA as well as IT helpdesk. I'm also a Computer Science master's student at 
Georgia Tech with a specialization in Computing Systems in the OMSCS program.

I'm participating in bioinfomatic research in McGrath Lab where we are studying the behavior of cichlid bowers through machine 
learning and computer vision. I work with improving the automated pipeline project.
